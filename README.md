## Project Information

The first of four(4) learning projects before the second certification project in freeCodeCamp's [Responsive Web Design course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/).

The course/project description from their website is as follows:

> Every HTML element is its own box â€“ with its own spacing and a border. This is called the Box Model. In this course, you'll use CSS and the Box Model to create your own Rothko-style rectangular art pieces.
